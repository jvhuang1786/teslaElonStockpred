It\u2019s great!","77":"The was not to outcompete other companies, but rather to maximize usefulness & rate of progress in the absolute","78":"For example, we created a chip design team from scratch for the Tesla full self-driving computer, which is not something car companies do","79":"Tesla should really be thought of as roughly a dozen technology startups, many of which have little to no correlation with traditional automotive companies","80":"We are putting a lot of effort into improving the Tesla China experience with local engineering & great feedback from Tesla owners in China!","81":"Cool, lmk what we can do to improve the product, especially vehicle software\/firmware, app & overall interaction with Tesla, as these changes can immediately improve the entire fleet","82":"Feels so long ago","83":"Pulling up to The Petersen","84":"Nice","85":"We will add one more PTO day after the annual review next quarter","86":"It will look a little odd","87":"Probably Fremont","88":"Probably good to combine them, since they are converging in time. I\u2019m hopeful we can announce a date after the July 4th week.","89":"Yes, but we will have to postpone annual shareholder meeting, as still no large gatherings allowed by July 7th.

They\u2019re pretty close together.","103":"It will be real","104":"Maybe Incat","105":"There will be many test flights before commercial passengers are carried. First Earth to Earth test flights might be in 2 or 3 years.","106":"We need to be far enough away so as not to bother heavily populated areas. The launch & landing are not subtle. But you could get within a few miles of the spaceport in a boat.","107":"Directionally correct, but Zenit is an order of magnitude smaller than Starship system & doesn\u2019t come back & land","108":"US law requires at least a green card to be hired at SpaceX, as rockets are considered advanced weapons technology","109":"Pretty much","110":"Illuminaughty haha","111":"SpaceX is building floating, superheavy-class spaceports for Mars, moon & hypersonic travel around Earth","112":"Maybe some Flextape","113":"No problem, we can buff it out","114":"Fairing reuse is looking good","115":"So where are the aliens?","116":"Or Y","117":"No larger pack Model 3 is in development","118":"Actually, we\u2019ve made slight changes, but the range improvement is >90% efficiency","119":"Cool","120":"Physics doesn\u2019t care about politicians","121":"Coming soon","122":"All Model S cars made since late Jan have 402 mile range.

North America catching up fast. Europe slightly behind.","126":"Looking likely","127":"Throttling is done by adjusting flow to the ox and fuel preburners. The lower limit of thrust is ox & fuel turbopump injector preburner \u201cstiffness\u201d, essentially when do the preburner elements start flaming out.","128":"Tank didn\u2019t burst, but leaked at 7.6 bar. This is a good result & supports idea of 304L stainless being better than 301. We\u2019re developing our own alloy to take this even further. Leak before burst is highly desirable.","129":"Yeah. Merlin, using a single pintle injector with cold, liquid propellant, needs a longer chamber than Raptor, which uses a large number of coaxial injectors, despite Merlin being less than half thrust. Propellant enters Raptor chamber as hot gas that\u2019s already mixed.","130":"Yes","131":"That\u2019s the goal. There a few known weak points on this test tank, probably capable of more pressure. The second test tank to follow shortly has addressed the weak points.","132":"Accurate","133":"Sure","134":"Around 20ms. It\u2019s designed to run real-time, competitive video games. Version 2, which is at lower altitude could be as low as 8ms latency.","135":"It will get even simpler. Just two instructions for Starlink: plug in & point at sky.

In the same way, a giant reusable rocket flight is way cheaper than a tiny expendable rocket that can be used only once.","142":"True","143":"Battery industry is world champion at bs. \u201cLithium-ion\u201d doesn\u2019t really mean anything.

H2 is hell.","160":"Tesla factory workplace safety is 5% better than industry average for manufacturers & improving fast","161":"Important technical note: due to higher O\/F of CH4 vs RP1 (oxygen is dense) & significant density increase of subcooled CH4 (plus no common dome insulation needed), plus cryo strength bump of CH4, tank mass of CH4\/O2 stage is almost same as RP1\/O2.","162":"We could never reach 380 Isp with RP\/kerosene. CH4 has higher Isp potential on paper, but even better in practice. With CH4, you can reach >99% of max theoretical combustion efficiency, but RP is ~97% on a good day & requires desooting of turbines between flights.","163":"After which they are recycled","164":"Tesla batteries are lasting much longer than 200k miles \/ 320k km","165":"Moreover, energy produced by Tesla solar deployments far exceeds energy used in our factories","166":"Electric cars produce *much* less CO2 than fossil fuel cars, taking both electricity emission & vehicle production into acount","167":"Posting Tesla Impact Report, this time with summary points & charts in my reply tweets https:\/\/www.tesla.com\/ns_videos\/2019-tesla-impact-report.pdf","168":"Haha.

I should credit Soviet\/Russian engine work in the 80\u2019s as being a factor in deciding to switch from H2 to CH4.

That\u2019s why I\u2019m not super worried about early Starship failures. Initial serial numbers are suboptimal, so would be lawn ornaments if they survived. That said, as lawn ornaments go, they\u2019re pretty sweet \u2026","798":"Sure","799":"We are hearing almost all hospital ICUs have excess capacity. In some cases, 60% empty.","800":"Interesting","801":"They were, but are they currently?","802":"We\u2019re working super hard on getting traffic lights & stops released. Reverse summon (auto park) will be part of the core Autopilot software upgrade for FSD later this year.","803":"I know of two nurses who had their job offers revoked, one in NYC and one in Arlington","804":"Some of the small launcher activity is cool, especially @rocketlab. Downsides are helicopter retrieval doesn\u2019t scale to bigger rockets &amp; is highly weather-dependent. Also, propulsive landing is needed for moon\/Mars. That said, it\u2019s probably right move for small LEO vehicle.","805":"My (again) personal favorite is","806":"Tesla *was* saved by an investment in May 2009 from Daimler, not govt. Without that Daimler support, Tesla would have died. Super appreciated!","807":"Vast majority of \u201cventilators\u201d are not intratracheal, but, yes, jamming a pipe down a patient\u2019s throat & driving in high pressure, pure oxygen is definitely not how we evolved! My personal choice would be mask with moderate pressure at ~50% O2.","808":"SN26","809":"Merlin is arguably version 6 or 7 by now. It\u2019s a real workhorse, but looks so simple next to Raptor!","810":"The way things are looking right now, the world will soon be flooded with excess ventilators. Even NY is giving them away!","811":"Fundamentally, Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch","812":"Yeah, Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine, but not US. Also, their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage & payload separation system also not US.","813":"Tesla actually sent out ResMed, Philips & Medtronic units. Latter is fully intratracheal. My personal opinion is that some ICUs are jumping the gun on intubation & setting PEEP & O2 too high. High pressure, pure oxygen increases risk of lung damage.","814":"Sorry, meant to say only US rocket. Atlas V is close, but not yet 100%.","815":"Exactly. In mid 2009, Tesla received non-binding approval for loan program actually signed into law by Bush in late 2008. First actual disbursement was Q2 2010, long after BK danger passed. Loan was repaid early with interest. Taxpayers made money on it!!","816":"Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often & is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing.","817":"Also, it costs less $to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That\u2019s the acid test.","818":"True. Only reason other medium & heavy lift rocket companies are winning any missions at all is due to govt intervention. Otherwise, they\u2019d be as defunct as expendable airplane companies. ULA is powered by lobbying.","819":"Sounds about right","820":"Roughly what is the survival rate of intubated patients? I\u2019m hearing 10% to 20%. Is this overly pessimistic?","821":"It is about 10% too small, but lots of fun \ud83d\ude00","822":"A mask or nose \u201cventilator\u201d with moderately increased oxygen % will help. This is common in hospitals. Intubation, where a tube is jammed down your throat under sedation & you\u2019re fed high pressure, pure oxygen for several days to weeks is questionable.","823":"So true","824":"Reduced size by ~3%, center line is more level & lower window sill height","825":"\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23","826":"All new","827":"Reviewing overall system with vehicle engineering team next week.

The new rear seats will accommodate larger passengers than before.","2405":"Actually, Model 3 would beat the Taycan on N\u00fcrburgring over multiple laps, as it has more range","2406":"Landing leg frame","2407":"Busted","2408":"Exactly","2409":"Haha","2410":"Apollo","2411":"A little, but this is mostly a design update for those interested","2412":"Yes","2413":"Glad you\u2019re ok!","2414":"You never know \u2026","2415":"Absolutely","2416":"Feeling Lucky (Google tribute!) or Hungry are 100% intended for max enjoyment of Tesla owner. If location has destination chargers, that\u2019s a plus, but car should only route there if location is great. This will be hit & miss initially, but should hone towards excellent over time.","2417":"10.1","2418":"Great conversation-starter!","2419":"Damn \u2026","2420":"I want this T-shirt!","2421":"Service center expansion is at max speed, so yes","2422":"Sure, I\u2019m planning on meeting community supporters around the presentation on the 28th. Thanks!","2423":"Joe Mode is the best mode","2424":"I \u2665\ufe0f visiting Boca Chica, Brownsville &amp; Texas in general! Thanks for all your support!!","2425":"Thanks Tesla owners. You rock!! \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f","2426":"Yes, coming soon","2427":"Oh that would be fun. Will see.","2428":"Maybe we can buffer enough of it onboard. Will check.","2429":"Getting close","2430":"\ud83d\ude80\u2665\ufe0f Starship Team \u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\ude80","2431":"That\u2019s what we believe is highly likely","2432":"Agreed","2433":"They used to have butt bellows for blowing smoke up your \u2026 along the Thames River in London https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tobacco_smoke_enema","2434":"Sagan was awesome","2435":"Personally, I think the universe looks great for 12 billion years, let alone 13.8","2436":"Hopefully, next year","2437":"There aren\u2019t really meant to be \u201cTesla incentives\u201d, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all.","2438":"Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval.","2439":"Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining.","2440":"The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally & should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world.","2441":"That\u2019s not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous & possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I\u2019m looking into it","2442":"Should note that these product mix & logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK & Ireland right now, but we don\u2019t raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win.","2443":"Exactly! We\u2019ve only one car factory in California & one Gigafactory (for batteries & drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries & drive units for the greater China area. Over time, regional Gigafactories will lower costs & improve logistics worldwide.","2444":"Good analysis. You can order commercial solar in literally 30 secs if you use Apple Pay at http:\/\/Tesla.com\/bigsolar.","2445":"However, we won\u2019t customize the contract or engage in negotiations. That just causes the Tesla & customer legal bill to be high & drag things out. Pay for clean power, not lawyers! It makes way more sense.","2446":"Wise words from Gary the Bot","2447":"At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes & logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply\/demand imbalances.","2448":"Tesla commercial solar ordering now live at http:\/\/Tesla.com\/bigsolar!","2449":"Ahem","2450":"At least they had great cigars \ud83d\udc4d","2451":"Haha exactly!","2452":"Yes, that\u2019s exactly what I meant, Gary the Bot!","2453":"Yes","2454":"Soon","2455":"Flux capacitor option package","2456":"Yes","2457":"Model S at N\u00fcrburgring has 7 seats","2458":"Yes. To be clear, Plaid powertrain is about a year away from production & applies to S,X & Roadster, but not 3 or Y.

It was like World War Z, but mason jars \u2026","2493":"Aargh!!","2494":"Getting ready for flight of orbit-class Starship design","2495":"\ud83d\udc4d","2496":"Hoping to open in Romania soon!","2497":"Actually true","2498":"Ceres, Callisto, Ganymede & Titan","2499":"And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest","2500":"Deep lore","2501":"Wow cool","2502":"Definitely","2503":"Probability that we\u2019re in base Polytopia is highly unlikely - KWM","2504":"Why aren\u2019t more people talking about this!?","2505":"Sea level Raptor\u2019s vacuum Isp is ~350 sec, but ~380 sec with larger vacuum-optimized nozzle","2506":"For sure","2507":"Precisely","2508":"Photoshop is amazing","2509":"Most likely","2510":"Over time, 355 & 385 are possible, but very difficult","2511":"Raptor turbines can spin up extremely fast. We take it easy on the test stand, but that\u2019s not indicative of capability.","2512":"Not currently planning for pad abort with early Starships, but maybe we should. Vac engines would be dual bell & fixed (no gimbal), which means we can stabilize nozzle against hull.","2513":"Everything happens so fast. It\u2019s such a different paradigm that applying aircraft concepts to rockets is almost like applying shipping concepts to aircraft. Travels 10,000 km in 30 mins.","2514":"You know destination weather before departure & there\u2019s no weather in space","2515":"\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23","2516":"Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you haven\u2019t moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust, you\u2019ll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox & fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it, you\u2019re prob ok.","2517":"Failure rate is actually both higher & lower than that, as the Falcon 9 design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful), but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate.","2518":"It\u2019s not","2519":"Sounds about right","2520":"Sounds sweaty","2521":"But Taycan does seem like a good car. N\u00fcrburgring track time is great.","2522":"Tesla doing laps at Nerdburgering","2523":"We\u2019re almost there","2524":"November most likely","2525":"No, probably V10.1","2526":"Wanted to build an electric car company in college.

Smart summon is almost great. Drive-in theater mode, caraoke & Cuphead are awesome.","2530":"Merging code branches & one more QA-level release this week. Hopefully, EAP wide release week after.","2531":"10 years ago \u2026","2532":"We might be in one right now","2533":"Yes","2534":"Very exciting to see India\u2019s rapid progress in space! There are always setbacks, of course, but I think India is doing great overall.","2535":"Definitely for Space Force. We need to make Starfleet real.","2536":"For the remainder of September, Tesla is permanently waiving the $1500 solar removal fee requirement. Note, the ability to stop monthly payments at any time remains.","2537":"Without the removal fee, Tesla Solar is unequivocally a guaranteed, instant money printer, producing $300 to $1000 per year (in after tax income!)","2538":"Also","2539":"Offer me money, offer me power \u2026","2540":"Hadouken!!","2541":"Over time, it will be 100% sustainable","2542":"Thanks for offering!

Has an amazingly immersive, cinematic feel due to the comfy seats & surround sound audio.","2839":"When full self-driving is approved by regulators, we will enable video while moving","2840":"Yeah, feels just like an old school drive in movie experience, but with much better sound","2841":"We\u2019re close, but the magic is in the final details. Maybe 2 to 3 months.","2842":"Can\u2019t you just play though phone Bluetooth?","2843":"Encounter in 88","2844":"Starhopper flight successful.

Maximizing emissivity is best for conductive\/particle heating. Nice thing about steel is that tiles can be very thin, unlike carbon fiber or aluminum airframe.","2858":"Wearing black not recommended","2859":"High reflectivity minimizes photonic heating, high emissivity minimizes particle heating. No need to radiate heat away if you aren\u2019t hot in the first place. Also, as metal heats up to yellow\/red\/white, it stops being reflective.","2860":"Me too","2861":"In a million years, the Universe will go from being 13.772 to 13.773 billion years old.

Starts around 8pm.","2936":"Presentation streaming live from http:\/\/Neuralink.com at 8pm Pacific","2937":"If we make all cars with FSD package self-driving, as planned, any such Tesla should be worth $100k to $200k, as utility increases from ~12 hours\/week to ~60 hours\/week","2938":"No, since Tesla will charge a % fee for being in our robotaxi fleet, but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is, otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers","2939":"Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you can\u2019t make enough of them & we won\u2019t be able to.","2940":"Cost of Tesla full self-driving option increasing by ~$1000 on August 16","2941":"Agreed. That\u2019s approximately date when we expect Enhanced Summon to be in wide release. It will be magical.

Doing an in-depth engineering review of Enhanced Summon later today.","2956":"Initially, single plane, but hopefully multi-story later this year","2957":"Will trace back inertial measurements & wheel movements to exit multilevel garage, unless car was teleported into position, in which case all bets are off","2958":"Yeah, that\u2019s next after summon","2959":"Yes, but owner will have to accept tiny risk of damage. Those are very hard even for careful human drivers.","2960":"Haha yes","2961":"We changed the design quite a bit. More about this in late July.","2962":"Great team","2963":"Raptor engine mounted on Starhopper. Aiming for hover test Tues.","2964":"Sure","2965":"~20m up & sideways for first flight. Mk1 Starship hopefully 20km up in a few months.","2966":"Cont of main","2967":"3","2968":"More like 30 to 40 mT to GTO ~27 deg.

We\u2019ll keep it above 50% for this flight.","2970":"Take note","2971":"100mT to 125mT for true useful load to useful orbit (eg Starlink mission), including propellant reserves. 150mT for reference payload compared to other rockets.

Concrete seams too. So glamorous.","3130":"Other rocket engines were designed for no (or almost no) reuse. Raptor is designed for heavy & immediate reuse, like an aircraft jet engine, with inspections required only after many flights, assuming instrumentation shows it good.

Thanks for your great photos!","3814":"It will enable video when parked & connected to WiFi. All Tesla Superchargers will have free WiFi over time.","3815":"Car looks for a slightly turning force on wheel (direction is irrelevant) to confirm that driver hands are on steering wheel before initiating lane change. Just a precautionary measure until we have a few billion miles\/km of real-world lane changes with reliability >> human.","3816":"Good idea","3817":"Radar","3818":"Starhopper just lifted off & hit tether limits!","3819":"Latest Autopilot update is epic. Rolling out to all US owners with Enhanced Autopilot or Full Self-Driving option. International coming soon.","3820":"Many different regulatory authorities. Just takes time.","3821":"Base AP will have same NN, so core functionality also improves","3822":"Exactly","3823":"Sure","3824":"Are you on Mad Max Mode? This may be too meek for places like the LA Freeway \u2026","3825":"Almost done","3826":"Tesla Enhanced Summon coming out in US next week for anyone with Enhanced Autopilot or Full Self-Driving option","3827":"Team is working on international versions super hard btw. Unfortunately, regulators around the world have different rules & processes, so just takes time.","3828":"That would be cool.

What\u2019s not well understood is that Tesla cars being made *today* will be able to do that for you. Just a matter of finishing the software & going through regulatory approval. Will be explained in depth via live webcast on April 22.","3833":"Thanks \ud83d\ude00","3834":"Great work with Stripe btw. Much needed.","3835":"Yes","3836":"Only external cameras are being used right now, so internal is not enabled.

Should be lower & allow below current \u201c0%\u201d level. Making that adjustment too.","3870":"Night mode with 0% brightness is actually too dark during the day. This is ultimately our fault.

Side boosters come back to Cape, center core lands on droneship. Latter will be coming in v hot & fast, so dicey.","3908":"Annoying that @ULA perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy can\u2019t. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct, but that\u2019s very rare.","3909":"Yeah, Falcon Heavy Block 5 has way more performance than last year\u2019s vehicle. Lot of room to increase side booster load transfer & max Q without changing any parts. FH Block 5 can launch more payload to any orbit than any vehicle currently flying.","3910":"Probably no fairing either & just 3 Raptor Vacuum engines.

Not impossible.","3911":"Retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable.

Major improvement over Dragon 1.","3934":"We should send probes to outer solar system & get high res, true color images of these strange things. Maybe there\u2019s an alien artifact out there \u2026","3935":"Massive delta velocity slam from highly elliptical Earth orbit using a fully retanked, but lightened up Starship with no heat shield or fins\/legs. Best choice for the impatient. Ion engines are too slow.","3936":"Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 & HW3.

Suborbital flights with three.","3984":"Hopefully. Always many issues integrating engine & stage. First hops will lift off, but only barely.","3985":"Started rolling it out a few days ago. Always starts slow, find rare corner case issues, fix them, continue rollout \u2026","3986":"Raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. We\u2019re simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. Going to 25% would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed.","3987":"Agreed","3988":"Working on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica, Texas, and Cape Kennedy, Florida. Will also be building Starship & Super Heavy simultaneously in both locations.","3989":"You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump & combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber.","3990":"Goes against interests of all Texans","3991":"Full size","3992":"Transpiration cooling will be added wherever we see erosion of the shield. Starship needs to be ready to fly again immediately after landing. Zero refurbishment.","3993":"White-hot parts reached orbital entry temp of around 1650 Kelvin","3994":"Yes, full duration","3995":"Falcon rocket booster is aluminum-lithium & carbon fiber, which have low max temperature allowables. Super Heavy booster is stainless steel. Since it only goes to around Mach 8 or 9, moreover at high altitude, it needs no heat shield, not even paint.","3996":"Only some of the hottest sections","3997":"No straight path for hot gas to accelerate through the gaps","3998":"Hexagonal tiles on most of windward side, no shield needed on leeward side, transpiration cooling on hotspots","3999":"Testing Starship heatshield hex tiles","4000":"Not exactly same time, as countries have different regulations & we try to build in batches to simplify production","4001":"End Titles from Blade Runner played after Model Y webcast cut","4002":"About a minute in, we flashed a teaser pic of Tesla cyberpunk truck","4003":"Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isn\u2019t critical for snowy regions.","4004":"Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but that\u2019s a lot of complexity.","4005":"Might arrive by June, but def before end of summer","4006":"Designed to feel much bigger on inside than it looks on outside. An incredibly important principle.","4007":"This causes some media confusion, as batch builds & ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month & terrible following month, but consumer tastes don\u2019t actually vary so much. Massive month over month changes are usually because of production\/shipping schedules.","4008":"To be clear, orders are fully refundable, even after you\u2019ve had your Tesla for a week","4009":"Definitely down the road, once construction & upgrades aren\u2019t so crazy","4010":"If someone really wants to return the car in good faith on day 8, that\u2019s fine","4011":"Still get this question a lot, even though Norway \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf4 has highest Tesla cars per person on \ud83c\udf0f (super appreciated!).

Had I been better, our first 3 launches might have succeeded, but I learned from those mistakes.","4200":"That said, I still only own 0.25 BTC, which a friend sent me several years ago. Don\u2019t have any crypto holdings.","4201":"Whoever owns the early BTC deserves a Nobel prize in delayed gratification","4202":"Not true. Limiting factor in any staged combustion rocket engine, liquid\/gas or gas\/gas, is pressure & temperature in oxygen preburner","4203":"So true \ud83e\udd21 John Clarke \ud83d\udc4c","4204":"SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust\/weight & thrust\/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but I\u2019m worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics.","4205":"Exactly. That\u2019s the critical point for Starship\/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species.","4206":"SpaceX commercial \ud83d\ude80 launch market share went from 0% in 2010 to 65% in 2018. Despite massive subsidies to Boeing\/Lockeed, they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years.","4207":"Don\u2019t know","4208":"Actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for \u201claunch capability\u201d. Even if they do zero launches, US govt still gives them that.","4209":"That\u2019s true \ud83d\ude00 Merlin 1A was terrible. 1C was ok, 1D good, but block 5 Merlin (should probably be called 1E) is something special. Took about 15 years to get there.","4210":"Yeah, that was a bit embarrassing \u263a\ufe0fHigh engine chamber pressure and ablative don\u2019t get along. Ok for low pressure, expendable upper stage.","4211":"We are constrained by the accredited investor rule, but will think about how this could be done","4212":"Essentially, yes. Great engineering talent, but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and self-sustaining city on Mars.","4213":"You can see the streaks on the vacuum Merlin nozzle in flight videos","4214":"Exactly. Super money move is anti-matter drive, especially if you solve capturing antiprotons in deep space.","4215":"Anti-matter production would require vast amounts of energy. No need though. We have a super reliable, massive, free fusion reactor called the sun.","4216":"Merlins. The max chamber pressure run damaged Raptor SN 1 (as expected). A lot of the parts are fine for reuse, but next tests will be with SN 2, which is almost done.","4217":"Yes","4218":"To the first part. I doubt we\u2019d create a Dyson ring or sphere.","4219":"SN2 has changes that should help","4220":"Advanced, reusable rockets are all we need to become a multiplanet civilization. Once we have a city on Mars, interplanetary travel will create a forcing function for vast improvements in spaceflight.","4221":"Pinter injector tends to have hot & cold streaks.

Maybe 382 if we get lucky.","4262":"Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 & O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship\/Super Heavy.","4263":"Much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar.

Will take us time to work up to 300 bar. That is a mad level.","4599":"Yes. Radically redesigned Raptor ready to fire next month.","4600":"Seriously! We are just on the wrong planet for SSTO. Mars, no problem.","4601":"You def don\u2019t want electric pumps on a rocket engine! Raptor turbopumps alone need 100,000 horsepower per engine. That\u2019s not a typo.","4602":"Yes, but single stage to orbit with no payload is pointless. Add Super Heavy rocket booster & orbital payload is gigantic. Only need booster on Earth, due to deep gravity well & thick atmosphere. Starship alone on moons & Mars.","4603":"Coldformed at cryo","4604":"It\u2019s embarrassing that Boeing\/Lockheed need to use a Russian engine on Atlas, but that engine design is brilliant","4605":"This test hopper is at full body diameter of 9m \/ 30 ft, just not full height.

Subways are fine, but it\u2019s time to upgrade to something better.","4629":"All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians & cyclists","4630":"Capable of traveling safely at over 150mph. At that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city.","4631":"Yes","4632":"This can be applied to any autonomous, electric vehicle, not just Tesla","4633":"Tesla in @boringcompany tunnel with retractable wheel gear that turns a car into a rail-guided train &amp; back again","4634":"I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding 3rd St.","4635":"If all vehicles were densely seated buses, throughput in excess of 100,000 people per hour per lane is possible, but better to offer a range of vehicles & let people decide what makes them happy","4636":"You\u2019re right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didn\u2019t include it. We\u2019re working on one that makes things clear.","4637":"Pop up, park and walk!","4638":"Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp & elevator. Latter only for tight spaces.","4639":"Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees.","4640":"The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber & a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume.","4641":"Exactly","4642":"Are tunnels safe in an earthquake?","4643":"Autopilot doesn\u2019t need the guide wheels. They\u2019re only there if there is a complete system failure.

Next tunnel will be made with V2 (Line-Storm). V3 (Prufrock), aspirationally 10X better, should be operational next year. For reference:","4648":"\ud83d\udc4d","4649":"Passive lateral safety is required by regulators & I think they\u2019re right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument.","4650":"Yeah, I wrote that back in 2006, almost 13 years ago!","4651":"Totally false.

Will take care of it.","4675":"Love that people are buying a Tesla for the product itself, even if they don\u2019t believe in climate change. Not everyone can be convinced about global warming, but if an electric car is simply the best product, they don\u2019t need to be.","4676":"60 Mins actually had several hours of interview time, which they distilled to 14 mins.

Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late 2004. He\u2019d originally filed for it in 1994. Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later.","4699":"Yeah, we wanted to name our company after Tesla, the great scientist\/engineer, but use of the Tesla name in automotive was already trademarked in the US, Europe & later China.","4700":"Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car 1997-2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldn\u2019t exist or would have started much later.","4701":"It was supposed to be, but that was a dumb decision. In the end, Roadster only had 7% of parts in common with the Lotus Elise or any other car.","4702":"Machete!!","4703":"If you have a Tesla built in past 2 years, definitely try Navigate on Autopilot. It will blow your mind. Automatically passes slow cars & takes highway interchanges & off-ramps.","4704":"Full self-driving option is required with the Tesla designed hardware 3 computer.

Appears to be undamaged & is transmitting data. Recovery ship dispatched.","4712":"Yes, cutaway was a mistake. We will show all footage, good or bad.","4713":"Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. Given this event, we will likely add a backup pump & lines.","4714":"Engines stabilized rocket spin just in time, enabling an intact landing in water!

We will inquire.","4810":"Ok","4811":"Lot on our plate, so it\u2019s either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler & produce sooner or do all & produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way.

Model S & X have hospital grade HEPA filters. Maybe helpful for transporting people.","4863":"That is true & should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy.

This is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible.","4922":"Aspirationally, they will be made to the exact same specification, but we can vary cell quantity to account for empirical variation","4923":"Haha","4924":"Recently asked service team to expand locations to all population regions (not just major metros) in North America, Eastern Europe, China & Japan by end of next year.

Those videos are from this morning.","5597":"Simulating maneuvering through a narrow passage","5598":"According to divers who have made the passage, yes. However, we also made an exact replica that is inflatable, so that the entire path can be tested without risk of blockage.","5599":"A second one that is 30cm shorter is almost complete","5600":"That would be cool.

Hopefully useful. If not, perhaps it will be in a future situation.","5624":"I want to know who is running the Etherium scambots! Mad skillz \u2026","5625":"It is both alarming & explanatory that you run a psych ward","5626":"Diver weight belts wrapped around outside. Mini-sub only weighs ~40kg dry, so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave, then add weight belts for wet sections.","5627":"Yeah, that sounds cool. Music makes things better. Calms the mind. Adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio & phone\/music player.","5628":"Aluminum shell has high thermal conductivity, so will be close to ambient. If ambient is cold, a thin layer of neoprene insulation around interior will keep occupant warm.","5629":"Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience & tenacity of kids & diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best.","5630":"Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does.","5631":"Can\u2019t be too buoyant","5632":"Yes. All-weather. ~300km\/h high altitude winds. ~60km\/h ground winds. It\u2019s a beast.","5633":"Ground winds would","5634":"Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust.","5635":"Fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open air. Segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights & adjust bouyancy.","5636":"Construction complete in about 8 hours, then 17 hour flight to Thailand","5637":"I\u2019m in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid mini-sub","5638":"4 handles\/hitch points on front & 4 on rear. 2 air tank connections on front & 2 on rear, allowing 1 to 4 tanks simultaneously connected, all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak develops.","5639":"Yes","5640":"Yes","5641":"Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd & 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps & tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up & then transit.","5642":"So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out & water won\u2019t come in","5643":"Does you know output voltage & amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed.","5644":"SpaceX & Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.","5645":"Great, thanks","5646":"So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power.","5647":"Have a small velcro slit entrance & exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)","5648":"Walking speed is around 5km\/h, but if you\u2019re in an air tube, time doesn\u2019t matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections.","5649":"Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network & inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof & auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.","5650":"Inflatable tubes & pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand & is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.","5651":"Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks & front\/rear rope tow hitch & lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?","5652":"Interesting","5653":"I would def recommend this","5654":"Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large.","5655":"It\u2019s open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution","5656":"Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube & rock wall.","5657":"Yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about in that tweet \u2014 double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying.","5658":"You\u2019re welcome. Happy birthday! \ud83c\udf81\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf82","5659":"Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod & vent valve in rear.

Is this true?","5666":"@lopezlinette has published several false articles about Tesla, including a doozy where she claimed Tesla scrapped more batteries than our total S,X &amp;3 production number, which is physically impossible.","5667":"Wow, so @sal19 of @Reuters wrote article that misled public about Model 3 production &amp; followed that up with mean tweet to me on my bday.

Did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue?","5676":".@Reuters is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by 800 cars. S\/X annual prod is set at ~100k, ie 1,900\/week.

This is not journalism.","5690":".@lopezlinette You stated publicly that you \u201csee eye to eye\u201d with Chanos, the most prominent short-seller of Tesla.

Hopefully, I\u2019m not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing.","5981":"That\u2019s quite a blast from the past! After my Zip2 experience w patents, I felt that patents (particularly software) inhibited innovation, instead of fostering it. I aspired to file zero patents after that. In 2014, we open-sourced all Tesla patents","5982":"In early 90s, I wrote a multitasker for PCs that spoofed the CPU & CD-ROM to act in parallel, so could read video continuously while player sprite moved smoothly.

The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time.","5989":"You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we don\u2019t think there will be another.","5990":"Correct, pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too, but there\u2019s no escaping Newton\u2019s Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) & O2.

Will do so after Model 3 production reaches 5k\/week steady.","5994":"Yes","5995":"Sigh. This is crux of matter: can\u2019t make system too annoying or people won\u2019t use it, negatively affecting safety, but also can\u2019t allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially.","5996":"Of course, but it\u2019s the kind of hustle that you like even with full knowledge. People can obv read the Internet & anyone who wants a refund will get one. I predict basically zero. The honest-to-goodness fun value is amazing & we\u2019re never going to make them again.","5997":"Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. It\u2019s what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions. Extremely robust \u2014 literally bulletproof.","5998":"Not recommended for urban environments","5999":"Thanks!

This is way worse than I thought.","6180":"Because Twitter is fun","6181":"Definitely did not. I\u2019ve been through many press cycles & know full well same person praising me today will trash me tomorrow.

I tried to use their product & it didn\u2019t work. Not exactly a genius move by WSJ, but they were brave enough to say it.","6220":"Yes, because Tesla has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world & products that haven\u2019t been unveiled yet.

The point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media. They don\u2019t realize how little credibility they actually have with the public.","6229":"Why are certain journalists (editors especially) so concerned about the public rating their credibility? All they do all day is rate others, ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have contempt.","6230":"I did to any who asked","6231":"The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them","6232":"Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article & track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor & publication.

But maybe there is a solution.","6237":"Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks he\u2019s above criticism. Try being truthful & the public will believe you again.","6238":"Thought you\u2019d say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks \u201cYou\u2019re just like Trump!\u201d Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more.

UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived & gave people back their jobs. They haven\u2019t forgotten UAW betrayed them. That\u2019s why UAW can\u2019t even get people to attend a free BBQ, let alone enough sigs for a vote.","6258":"Enough of the public does care about the truth. I have faith in the people.","6259":"It is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than Tesla & millions more auto deaths, but somehow get less coverage. We are not perfect, but we\u2019re doing our best to make clean energy real & be a good company.","6260":"Will do","6261":"Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets)","6262":"That\u2019s why editors are included too","6263":"We don\u2019t. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.","6264":"Even if some of the public doesn\u2019t care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors & publications will. It is how they define themselves.","6265":"No, they\u2019re just some rich kids in Berkeley who took their political science prof too seriously","6266":"Stop, you\u2019re making me blush \u263a\ufe0f","6267":"Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body\/chassis weight front, he wasn\u2019t fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars.","6268":"Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced.","6269":"To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today\u2019s Model S is far more refined than initial production.","6270":"ABS calibration algorithm","6271":"Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise & many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production.","6272":"Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won\u2019t stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car.","6273":"Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations.","6274":"Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little","6275":"Complexity is the devil. Words can\u2019t express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp & trying to get to profitability. But we\u2019ll try.","6276":"The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3\u2019s have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we\u2019ve seen anything like this.","6277":"Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3\u2019s having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers","6278":"Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance & others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out & address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update.","6279":"I definitely don\u2019t do this 5 minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Can\u2019t be creative otherwise.","6280":"Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.","6281":"Will do it later this year. Too much on plate right now. Will be available as an upgrade from service.","6282":"I didn\u2019t meet with him","6283":"In theory true, but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM & Chrysler to bankruptcy & lost 200,000+ jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over & now it has 10k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry & everyone knows it.","6284":"Thanks again, have conveyed your words to the Tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing!","6285":"Great idea!","6286":"Love original Deus Ex! That would be awesome.","6287":"Just order your car with the James Bond option package. It\u2019s an off-menu item for those in the know \ud83d\ude09","6288":"But ya know what, let\u2019s test that theory. Maybe we do want UAW back, even tho UAW betrayed us 8 years ago & left us here to rot. Maybe we want UAW back even tho injury rate today is 1\/2 what it was with them & wages were lower. Maybe. Let\u2019s hold a vote & find out.","6289":"Interesting he stops at \u201809. That\u2019s when you drove GM & Chrysler into bankruptcy & lost tens of thousands of jobs for people that counted on you.","6290":"We\u2019re going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S, X & 3. What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?","6291":"Good point","6292":"No, UAW does that. They want divisiveness & enforcement of 2 class \u201clords & commoners\u201d system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a 2 class system! Managers & workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much.","6293":"More \u201cReveal\u201d bs. Tesla is overseen by Cal\/OSHA, most stringent labor safety org in US, & they\u2019ve never found us to misrepresent. On other hand, Ford, Chrysler & GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely, that info is missing from Reveal article \u2026","6294":"No problem","6295":"They are incorrect. We never met, nor have we ever been scheduled to meet.","6296":"For sure before snowfall this year","6297":"About 2% of Tesla, incl salaried & hourly, union & non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally & on social media & lied about it.","6298":"Yeah, \u201cReveal\u201d was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota\/GM was twice as high as today\u2019s non-union.","6299":"Exactly \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcab\ud83c\udf89! That will be really fun &amp; shed light on what\u2019s happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.","6300":"That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.","6301":"With production, 1st you need achieve target rate & then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model 3 right away wd cause Tesla to lose money & die. Need 3 to 6 months after 5k\/wk to ship $35k Tesla & live.","6302":"Exactly!

Major improvements all round.","6303":"It can tow far more than rated capacity","6304":"SpaceX Crew Dragon ship in anechoic chamber for EMI testing before being sent to @NASA Plum Brook vacuum chamber","6305":"Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines & tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false, but were reported as \u201cfacts\u201d by Reveal.","6306":"Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW & everybody already gets healthcare.","6307":"Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs.","6308":"\u2665\ufe0f\ud83e\udd84","6309":"Gwynne\u2019s awesome. Been SpaceX prez for 10 years. Super love working with her.","6310":"Cool, we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers & beeping forklifts you said didn\u2019t exist.

No need to bring the car in yourself & zero paperwork.","6314":"Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k.

We have enough for about 1000\/week right now.","6325":"Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec & top speed to 140 mph.","6326":"That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!","6327":"Good idea ...","6328":"Yes","6329":"Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model 3 in July.","6330":"It does so constantly, but so smoothly that you can\u2019t tell","6331":"They are correct. It\u2019s awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight.","6332":"Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. It\u2019s like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will.","6333":"They can form a union whenever they want & there\u2019s nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just don\u2019t want to.","6334":"Exactly","6335":"Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front & a motor in rear. One is optimized for power & one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down.

An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.","6359":"It certainly needs to be better & we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives & reduces injuries should be released.","6360":"It\u2019s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/business\/tesla-with-autopilot-slams-into-truck-stopped-at-red-light\/2018\/05\/12\/18d2e740-563e-11e8-a6d4-ca1d035642ce_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.7466cb626644","6361":"If someone is trying to control us through complicated sky patterns, they must really care.

Practical version would have a turbo compressor on front taking ram air pressure at near sonic to hypersonic speeds & driving that thru air skiis & rearward for thrust.","6951":"To be more inclusive, how about a \"pick your tech level\" setting.

Hopefully, Tesla can be helpful.","6964":"Sounds good, I look forward to talking later today","6965":"Tesla always charges the same price for a Powerwall (only taxes & shipping costs vary), so something is messed up here. I've asked my team to stop shipment to any installers charging excessive premiums.","6966":"The internal Tesla Powerwall install team in PR is very small right now. Sending experienced installers from continental US to hire & train local team as fast as possible.","6967":"Not good. Sounds like some 3rd party installers are taking advantage of Powerwall demand >> supply. Taking action \u2026","6968":"Tesla Semi unveil now Nov 16.

We are deep in production hell \ud83d\udd25","6973":"Probably 6 to 8 weeks","6974":"Med medical equipment has priority","6975":"I'm doing my best to recalibrate, but that is a fair criticism. However, if I wasn't inherently optimistic, I wouldn't be doing electric cars and rockets in the first place!","6976":"Yeah","6977":"Bear in mind that the production ramp is an exponential curve. Late Oct is possible, but not certain. Literally every day makes a big difference.","6978":"There is only one config being built right now, so the only question is \"What color?\".

Now I need to get back to work...","6981":"The singularity for this level of the simulation is coming soon. I wonder what the levels above us look like. Good chance they are less interesting and deeper levels are better. So far, even our primitive sims are often more entertaining than reality itself.","6982":"I believe I can fly","6983":"Final episode was disgustingly good","6984":"The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too. Such a decision would be in the hands of the PR govt, PUC, any commercial stakeholders and, most importantly, the people of PR.","6985":"I know that closet is nice and warm, but it's time you admitted you are one of the creators of the next one.

Moreover, we expect to expand the facility significantly over time.","7014":"Does my hivemind count as me?","7015":"Def not ok.

We messed up a lot before it finally worked, but there's some epic explosion footage \u2026","7042":"Not sure, but probably","7043":"Feature coming soon","7044":"They're so real.

Also, thinking of going to the moon and actually going to the moon are not the same thing.","7064":"Funny thing is, whenever I suggest all companies go to zero incentives, room gets very quiet.

Yeah.","7083":"It is approximately the size of a carrot","7084":"Max velocity: Mach 6.9 Max altitude: 247 km Highest so far, but velocity matters much more","7085":"Max recovered booster velocity was Mach 7.9 (BulgarianSat). Energy is velocity squared, so this is a bigger difference than it appears","7086":"Neuralink is not raising money","7087":"WSJ has been laboriously negative for over a decade. I'm surprised they haven't bored their readers to death by now.","7088":"It was misinterpreted by Rolfe at WSJ as a fundraising effort. Neuralink is not seeking investors.","7089":"A midnight amendment, followed by a vigorously opposed subpoena.

They do need more power & energy, but rocket has plenty of that.","7311":"No, but shielding got fragged every flight. More control authority is for Falcon Heavy, but also enables Falcon 9 to land in heavier winds.","7312":"True, but that's a minor factor for rockets","7313":"Rocket was suddenly slammed sideways right before landing. Heavy gust or something malfunctioned onboard.

Only 7% of parts ended up being common.","7394":"Slow at first, then very fast.

Tough call, as high altitude wind shear was at 98.6% of the theoretical load limit.","7587":"Landing https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BTjUcEYBqSQ\/","7588":"Close-up of rocket stage separation, fast flip, boostback burn in a ring of fire and then\u2026 https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BTjVdLVB1bO\/","7589":"Couldn't agree more","7590":"Extremely","7591":"Even more boring","7592":"Boring","7593":"We def want to avoid either, particularly Surface Detail ...","7594":"On it now","7595":"Great food, great ambience and with great friends. We all really enjoyed the visit.","7596":"Will definitely do that on my next trip","7597":"Having moo moo at Moo Moo Gold Coast with amberheard, @CreepyPuppet and @CowanFilms https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BTPyhtBhdn6\/","7598":"That is the aspiration: to avoid AI becoming other.","7599":"Yeah, sorry I missed that. This would only work for 75 kWh packs that are software created to 60, so not 2013.","7600":"Tesla will soon be offering a compelling means of upgrading a 60 to a 75","7601":"Yes","7602":"Pickup truck unveil in 18 to 24 months","7603":"Next gen Roadster will be convertible","7604":"Tesla Semi truck unveil set for September. Team has done an amazing job. Seriously next level.","7605":"July","7606":"This investor group should buy Ford stock. Their governance is amazing ...","7607":"Autolist survey finds Tesla used car values are highest and sell fastest","7608":"Besides, I already said we'd add more independent members during SCTY merger. Will announce soon, but this group has nothing to do with it.","7609":"Yeah","7610":"Fairing is ~$5M, but that should be reusable this year. Am fairly confident we can reuse upper stage too by late next year to get to 100%.","7611":"Latency should only be 5 min max. Checking ...","7612":"Feature coming soon that allows one touch access to all discovered Tesla Easter eggs","7613":"And so the robots spared humanity ...","7614":"Exactly. Tesla is absurdly overvalued if based on the past, but that's irrelevant. A stock price represents risk-adjusted future cash flows.","7615":"Et tu, Walt?","7616":"Stormy weather in Shortville ...","7617":"Pretty good","7618":"It won't matter","7619":"It's just a helicopter in helicopter's clothing","7620":"Coal is dying due to nat gas fracking. It's basically dead.","7621":"Why did we waste so much time developing silly rockets? Damn you, aliens! So obtuse! You have all this crazy tech, but can't speak English!?","7622":"Technology breakthrough: turns out chemtrails are actually a message from time-traveling aliens describing the secret of teleportation","7623":"Def P100D with Ludicrous+, although the rocket starts going a lot faster after that","7624":"Good point, odds go from 0% to >0% :)","7625":"Thanks Phil!","7626":"Browser is already a little better. Kernel and browser update in prob 6 weeks or so (lots of underlying changes) with a few nice features.","7627":"Considering trying to bring upper stage back on Falcon Heavy demo flight for full reusability. Odds of success low, but maybe worth a shot.","7628":"Falcon Heavy test flight currently scheduled for late summer","7629":"Silliest thing we can imagine! Secret payload of 1st Dragon flight was a giant wheel of cheese. Inspired by a friend & Monty Python.","7630":"A lot","7631":"Looks like it could do 20% more with some structural upgrades to handle higher loads. But that's in fully expendable mode.","7632":"Working on it","7633":"We can def bring it back like Dragon. Just a question of how much weight we need to add.","7634":"Incredibly proud of the SpaceX team for achieving this milestone in space! Next goal is reflight within 24 hours.","7635":"If you just downloaded V8.1, tap the the T on center screen three times","7636":"On center screen. Also, center screen *will* show speed as an overlay that changes opacity according to relevance.","7637":"Here is the latest SpaceX travel ad for the flight around the moon & into deep space. Maybe needs a few edits ...","7638":"What gave me away?","7639":"No","7640":"Long Neuralink piece coming out on @waitbutwhy in about a week. Difficult to dedicate the time, but existential risk is too high not to.","7641":"You won't care","7642":"Glad to have Tencent as an investor and advisor to Tesla","7643":"Very few. We have yet to do a China (or Europe) launch of Model 3.","7644":"No","7645":"Model 3 was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different :)","7646":"Tues\/Wed","7647":"Because I was a dumb idiot and didn't realize at the time that it would cause confusion","7648":"Tues\/Wed next week","7649":"Yes. Model S will always be the fastest Tesla until next gen Roadster, which is a few years away.","7650":"Yes, but not until next year","7651":"Yes. Hardware already on all production S and X cars.","7652":"Sorta. Model 3 is like a BMW 3 series or Audi A4. Model S is like BMW 5 and 6 series, but much faster, more storage space + Autopilot","7653":"How about now?","7654":"Oh Model Y is coming too in a few years. Kinda have to.","7655":"All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves","7656":"Yes","7657":"I think so","7658":"Model 3 is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range & power & fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology.","7659":"Am noticing that many people think Model 3 is the \"next version\" of a Tesla, like iPhone 2 vs 3. This is not true.","7660":"Looking forward to playing the game with my kids!","7661":"I used to be one. You're welcome. Trying my best, at least. Hope it's a bit useful.","7662":"Just because I'm building a spaceship to get back to my home planet doesn't mean I'm an alien","7663":"The number of extinct single planet civilizations probably exceeds live civs by at least a thousand to one. I'm being optimistic.","7664":"Probably. Either that, simulation, great filter or they are very, very subtle.","7665":"I hope that didn't work","7666":"~spawn npc.alien","7667":"Where are the #%*> aliens?","7668":"No, we are minimizing configuration complexity to keep the production ramp on schedule. RWD only for early production, just like Model S.","7669":"Definitely","7670":"Yup, machine arrives next month and we start digging the tunnel!","7671":"How about the video we just took of the first Model 3 release candidate drive?","7672":"We cannot make all country versions simultaneously or the production start would be a disaster. You would get first in Norway.","7673":"Yes","7674":"Yes","7675":"I believe so","7676":"Yup","7677":"Oh so little faith","7678":"The shorter wheelbase only allows for a 75 kWh pack in Model 3 at current cell\/module energy densities","7679":"Yeah","7680":"Start taking orders in April","7681":"Yeah, probably a year from now. S will still win on acceleration though, due to having more space for a larger battery.","7682":"Only Model S will have the seven seater option, more cargo space, plus higher range, acceleration, two screens vs one, auto extend handles \u2026","7683":"The Model S produced today is arguably version 4. Let me put it this way: it is the car I will keep driving even after Model 3 arrives.","7684":"If fate is on our side, it will be amazing. Will talk about that in detail next week.","7685":"No problem :)","7686":"Should be summer next year. Sorry, really wish we could get RHD done sooner. We truly are working as fast as we can.","7687":"Let me just go fetch my magic wand ...","7688":"First in line for dual motor as soon as we can make it, which is probably in 6 to 9 months.","7689":"Damn straight we do! Coming with 8.1 next week.","7690":"First drive of a release candidate version of Model 3","7691":"It still has one display","7692":"Nothing majorly new that a consumer would notice. Lots of new tech in the design and production process though.","7693":"The more autonomous a car is, the less dash info you need. How often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a taxi?","7694":"Looks like Tues\/Wed for 8.1 release","7695":"I am not. This bill changes almost nothing about what NASA is doing. Existing programs stay in place and there is no added funding for Mars.","7696":"Perhaps there will be some future bill that makes a difference for Mars, but this is not it.","7697":"Except that isn't actually my house ...","7698":"3 is a great car, but definitely Model S","7699":"Good point","7700":"I wish. It's so annoying.","7701":"Finally, an explanation for daylight savings that makes sense ...","7702":"Ok","7703":"I love Wikipedia. Just gets better over time.","7704":"You're most welcome. Very exciting to discuss the future of electricity. Renewables + storage arguably biggest disruption since DC to AC.","7705":"Ironically, direct current is the right approach today, even though alternating was right in the past. Solar power & electronics both DC.","7706":"High voltage DC is for sure the best way to transmit electricity over long distances. Good explanation at https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/High-voltage_direct_current","7707":"Answer is complex for electric motors. We use an AC induction motor fed by a DC pack thru an IGBT inverter, which kinda \"digitizes\" DC power","7708":"Just wanted to write a note of appreciation to the many Australians who came out in support of the battery plan, especially @mcannonbrookes","7709":"Can only happen with your support, and working closely with key govt and utility leaders who are strongly committed to trying new approaches","7710":"Sure. Just check out my prior tweet on pricing ($250 kWh at pack level). Website will be updated soon, so there is complete transparency.","7711":"Looking forward to it. I know it's cliche, but LotR is my favorite book ever :) Want to see the set and take my kids on tour of greater NZ.","7712":"It's been a bear to get done, but prob 10 days or so, depending on full speed autosteer test results","7713":"Just spoke with @JayWeatherill, Premier of South Australia. Very impressed. Govt is clearly committed to a smart, quick solution.","7714":"Yes, but shipping, taxes\/tariffs and installation labor vary by country, as those costs are beyond our control","7715":"$250\/kWh at the pack level for 100MWh+ systems. Tesla is moving to fixed and open pricing and terms for all products.","7716":"Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?","7717":"Will send you one","7718":"Self-hatred","7719":"Thanks JJ!","7720":"Thank you for the lovely letter. That sounds like a great idea. We'll do it!","7721":"This is not true. TM works for a lot of people and that's great, but I've maybe done it 7 or 8 times ever.","7722":"SpaceX could not do this without NASA. Can't express enough appreciation.","7723":"SpaceX announcement tomorrow at 1pm PST","7724":"Fly me to the moon ... Ok http:\/\/www.spacex.com\/news\/2017\/02\/27\/spacex-send-privately-crewed-dragon-spacecraft-beyond-moon-next-year","7725":"of course","7726":"Roller coasters are awesome","7727":"maybe one of those too","7728":"Exactly :)","7729":"I didn't pose for it (hopefully that's obvious) or want me on cover. Tunnel boring machine pic wd be way better","7730":"Minor improvements update this weekend. High speed autosteer in about two weeks.","7731":"Good chance it will","7732":"Something on a tristate border might work. Gigafactory plus nearby supporting supply chain needs a very large workforce.","7733":"Excellent Tesla Model X review","7734":"Baby came back https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BQspL7Qhv1v\/","7735":"no","7736":"Just posted a video https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BQtNTk4Brqp\/","7737":"All systems go, except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd. Standing down to investigate.","7738":"Looks like we are go for launch. Added an abort trigger at T-60 secs for pressure decay of upper stage helium spin start system.","7739":"Provided Dragon 2 demo missions go well, SpaceX is highly confident of being able to fly US astronauts in 2018","7740":"spacex's photo https:\/\/instagram.com\/p\/BQnwNNsFy-3\/","7741":"Counting down to the first SpaceX launch from the Apollo 11 launch pad tomorrow morning (webcast\u2026 https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BQpXxl5BIYX\/","7742":"Not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak, but also not out of the question","7743":"If this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause","7744":"Uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (RP-1 kerosene) turbopump, so no dedicated pump or fluid needed","7745":"They are often right, but, in this case, we have already retired so much R&D risk on Dragon 2, that I feel very confident of 2018.","7746":"System was green for launch. I called it off.","7747":"Btw, 99% likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error), but that 1% chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day.","7748":"Investigating a (very small) leak in the upper stage. If ok, will launch tomorrow.","7749":"Yes, but only deep in solid rock, where the walls are self-supporting and concrete reinforcements arguably aren't needed","7750":"It's much easier to do the CGI that way","7751":"Yeah, exactly. So that makes it cool, right!?","7752":"You're right, I can't hide any more! I am Irony Man...","7753":"Apparently, there is this thing called \"Dad jokes\" and I make them","7754":"Yeah, awesome achievement by ISRO. Very impressive!","7755":"I used that one :)","7756":"You may come to regret that request :)","7757":"They are doing India proud","7758":"Ok, what are some good ones? Will have to meter these out. Hopefully, kids can't die from groaning too much.","7759":"Daylight rocket launch & landing at the Cape this weekend. Will be the 1st SpaceX flight from the Apollo launch pad.","7760":"Best place to watch is on the Cape causeway","7761":"Congrats to the Tesla owner who sacrificed damage to his own car to bring a car with an unconscious driver safely to a stop!","7762":"In appreciation, Tesla is providing all repair costs free of charge and expedited.","7763":"they were earlier drafts that I accidentally published. I said the same thing a week already.","7764":"Sounds like the Tesla Powerwall (consumer) and Powerpack (utility\/commercial) might be useful","7765":"Falcon 9 rocket now vertical at Cape Canaveral on launch complex 39-A. This is the same launch\u2026 https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BQWBz9zgOTP\/","7766":"Exactly. What this person said is untrue.","7767":"Please check your facts. Tesla and SpaceX joined as soon as we received the filing, which was Monday.","7768":"of course it will","7769":"Should all be uploaded by next month","7770":"Motor Trend could only achieve 2.4 sec when they tested the Porsche 918","7771":"I don't know what make you think that's a rocket. It's completely covered in a tarpaulin...","7772":"George Schultz and Jim Baker article in @WSJ regarding a carbon tax","7773":"No plans to take X, S (or 3) above 100 kWh. Semi necessarily and pickup truck maybe will go above.","7774":"Production Tesla Model S P100DL sets Motor Trend all-time world record to 60 mph in 2.27 sec","7775":"yes","7776":"Take out the floor mats and its 2.27. MT said everything had to be standard production.","7777":"Also, Tesla service can remove front trunk liner if you don't use it and improve performance further","7778":"No, will be lower. Wheelbase can't fit 100.","7779":"yes, altitude improves performance for electric. Opposite of combustion cars.","7780":"Hoping for summer this year","7781":"yes","7782":"You're right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is.","7783":"Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer. How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?","7784":"Exactly","7785":"Norway is great on all levels. Love Norway!","7786":"Yeah. And Twitter is a hater Hellscape.","7787":"Good grief, I'm not \"working\" for Trump. I'm trying to provide advice that helps take things in a more positive direction.","7788":"Actually, I think it's kinda cool :)","7789":"Isn't that basically like having a jury of peers? That is a default option in the US.","7790":"Those countries have strong justice systems, but I'd put them roughly on par with US. That rating system conflates many factors.","7791":"Did you read my tweets? I attacked it hard. Did not defend.","7792":"Not perfect & cd be better, but 10th out of 200+ countries with only a 0.08 diff to \"1st\" place means it's essentially on par","7793":"Also good. There are several that are on par with US. Just don't think any are better. People confuse laws with courts.","7794":"Mostly anti-drug laws","7795":"Exactly","7796":"The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law.","7797":"The remedy for that is changing the law","7798":"Ok, but what's up the wigs?","7799":"There are many good legal systems on par with US. Just don't know any that are better.","7800":"True!","7801":"Many in America don't realize how proud they should be of the legal system. Not perfect, but nowhere is the cause of justice better served.","7802":"Fair point, sorry","7803":"I will post an article he wrote half a century ago about flying through Africa and Asia in his plane. One of my favorite things.","7804":"True. Me being one of them :)","7805":"People should push to have as many moderates advising the President as possible. Blind hate is never the right answer.","7806":"I agree, great country! Looking forward to taking my kids for a visit. I've heard it is incredibly beautiful.","7807":"No rare earth metals in battery","7808":"Almost ready","7809":"App update is about two weeks out. Linux kernel and browser update probably a month or so. HW2 Autopilot has priority.","7810":"Yes, but Model 3 is the overwhelming priority","7811":"Signing off now. That was more than enough Twitter trouble for one morning!","7812":"A lot of terrible things could happen in four years of extremism. Do you really want another war? That's where extremism leads.","7813":"Yeah, it is hard to convey complex ideas in 140 chars and tone is lost in text","7814":"Almost there. We are just being very careful with the rollout.","7815":"Rolling out a new update today.","7816":"Numeric","7817":"Me too. I hope to get back to regularly scheduled programming soon ...","7818":"We should try our best","7819":"Gravimetric energy density of batteries and achieving a high cell mass fraction","7820":"I love Canada! I'm half Canadian. My Mom was born in Regina. My grandfather (her Dad) was American, born in Minnesota.","7821":"Mars is critical for the long-term survival of humanity and life on Earth as we know it","7822":"I just had three coffees :)","7823":"Really? Ok, I will work harder on thinking first and tweeting second. Sorry for anything thoughtless.","7824":"Yes, for now, but this should be addressed on all fronts: judicial, legislative and executive.","7825":"Yes. Green cards & dual citizens already ok. Work & spousal visas not yet, but hopefully soon. This is separate from judicial action.","7826":"Minecraft","7827":"Video of MIT's entrant into the SpaceX Hyperloop competition. Air has been removed from the Hyperloop tube to almost vacuum conditions.","7828":"maybe","7829":"First I've heard of this meeting. Will find out why.","7830":"At my request, the agenda for yesterday's White House meeting went from not mentioning the travel ban to having it be first and foremost","7831":"In addition, I again raised climate. I believe this is doing good, so will remain on council & keep at it. Doing otherwise would be wrong.","7832":"There has already been and there will be progress on this matter","7833":"Really don't want to get in politics. I just want to help invent and develop technologies that improve lives. Feels so bizarre.","7834":"26 ft diameter tunnel running 2 miles under D.C.","7835":"Nuances are important :)","7836":"That's exactly what I thought. Love Half-Life.","7837":"Wow, cool!","7838":"Then so be it. I'd rather do what I believe is right, than do what appears right simply to avoid criticism.","7839":"I wish!","7840":"Walking down the street and saw this","7841":"Regarding the meeting at the White House:","7842":"yes","7843":"Headline & article is misleading. I said it won't be retracted (ie withdrawn by Pres). It may be revoked by judicial or legislative means.","7844":"Yes, I believe that is critical to ensure a good future for humanity","7845":"Top AI researchers agree on principles for developing benefical AI","7846":"I agree with creating great jobs, restoring US strength as a great manufacturer of products and anything that makes the future exciting","7847":"Yeah, sorry about that :)","7848":"Yes, the order is still bad, but it is always important to read the source material","7849":"Reading the source material is better than reading other people's opinions about the source material","7850":"It is not","7851":"Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US. They've done right,not wrong & don't deserve to be rejected.","7852":"The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country\u2019s challenges","7853":"Please read immigration order. Lmk specific amendments. Will seek advisory council consensus & present to President.","7854":"Strategic & Policy Forum","7855":"Exactly. There is no possibility of retraction, but there is possibility of modification. It's just a non-zero possibility. Don't know more.","7856":"This is silly. If adding lanes actually did make it worse, that would imply removing lanes makes it better. Obv not true.","7857":"And we start digging the tunnel tonight","7858":"Hyperloop pod race happening this weekend at SpaceX HQ (near LAX). We built a ~mile long vacuum tube on our campus big enough to fit people.","7859":"Yeah, am hearing this from a lot of people & it's getting me down. I'm just trying to make a positive contribution & hope good comes of it.","7860":"No they don't","7861":"Tillerson at his confirmation hearing: \"I think it\u2019s important that the United States maintain its seat at the table in the conversation ...","7862":"... on how to address threats of climate change. They do require a global response.\"","7863":"Tillerson also said that \u201cthe risk of climate change does exist\u201d and he believed \u201caction should be taken\"","7864":"That may be a difficult award to decline","7865":"Sigh","7866":"Was wondering what those were","7867":"Rex Tillerson supports a carbon tax. This is what is really needed to move the needle.","7868":"I'm just saying that we should see what happens first. The actions may be surprising.","7869":"Exciting progress on the tunnel front. Plan to start digging in a month or so.","7870":"Maybe next month","7871":"Yup","7872":"Starting across from my desk at SpaceX. Crenshaw and the 105 Freeway, which is 5 mins from LAX","7873":"Earthquakes tend to have the biggest effect on the surface, like waves on water. That's why LA can have a (lame, but getting better) subway.","7874":"This may sound surprising coming from me, but I agree with The Economist. Rex Tillerson has the potential to be an excellent Sec of State.","7875":"3 months maybe, 6 months definitely","7876":"There will be a software update this weekend that improves self-calibration ability","7877":"I share The Economist's opinion that he should be given the benefit of the doubt unless his actions prove otherwise","7878":"Rex is an exceptionally competent executive, understands geopolitics and knows how to win for his team. His team is now the USA.","7879":"Ok, fine. Soldier 76. My dark secret is out ...","7880":"Yes, safety should improve significantly due to autonomy features, even if regs disallow no driver present","7881":"Autonomy capability should improve via OTA every 2 to 6 weeks","7882":"For now","7883":"The 100D price takes into account exchange rate shifts, whereas other vehicle prices haven't yet been adjusted","7884":"Yes. Block 5 is the final upgrade of the Falcon architecture. Significantly improves performance & ease of reusability. Flies end of year.","7885":"If we applied resources to doing super complex retrofits, our pace of innovation would drop dramatically","7886":"Tesla will never stop innovating. People are buying the wrong car if they expect this. There will be major revs every 12 to 18 months.","7887":"Yes","7888":"Auto steer limited to 45 mph on highways for now, i.e. heavy traffic, where it is needed most. Limit will raise as we get more data.","7889":"Car won't complete camera calibration. Working on software solution to adjust image crop dynamically, so camera more robust to pitch angle.","7890":"Autopilot for HW2 rolling out to all HW2 cars today. Please be cautious. Some cars will require adjustment of camera pitch angle by service.","7891":"Validating a GPU driver fix and camera pitch angle health check for HW2","7892":"Expendable. Future flights will go on Falcon Heavy or the upgraded Falcon 9.","7893":"Unfortunately, that would require stripping down the entire car and replacing 300+ parts. Wish there was an easy way.","7894":"Giant X made of Model X's by Tesla owners in China!","7895":"Looking good so far.

Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing.","8672":"However, that was not what prevented it being good.
